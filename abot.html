     <h1><u>About Me</h1></u>   
      <p>Hi! My name is Nur Syazwina Ibrahim, but most people call me Wina. I was born and raised in Kuala Nerang, Kedah, 
        and Iâ€™m currently a student at UiTM, pursuing a Diploma in Library Management. I would describe myself as someone calm, independent, and thoughtful. 
        I enjoy working with computers, organizing information, and learning things at my own pace.

        <p>During my free time, I usually spend time in my room, scrolling through my phone, listening to music, or taking naps to recharge. 
         I find peace in quiet moments and prefer a simple, peaceful lifestyle.

        <p>I believe that we only live once. Thatâ€™s why I try to appreciate every moment and stay positive, so I can live a life without regrets.
       
        <p>This website is a reflection of who I am â€” simple, sincere, and personal. Thank you for visiting :)
      </p>

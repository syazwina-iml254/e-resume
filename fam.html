   <h1><b>My Family</h1>

     <p>I come from a big and lively family, and I wouldn’t trade them for anything in the world. I’m the fifth child among seven siblings, and each of us has our unique personality that makes our family colourful. My father is a retired hospital staff member, and my mother is a housewife who always ensures our home is full of warmth and care. Some of my siblings are already married, so our family keeps growing — gatherings are always fun, noisy, and full of laughter!</p>

We enjoy spending time together, especially during family events, birthdays, and Hari Raya celebrations. Having a big family means there’s never a dull moment — someone is always joking, teasing, or cooking something delicious in the kitchen!
From them, I’ve learned patience, teamwork, and the meaning of unconditional love. My family is my biggest support system and the heart of who I am.</p>
